# iOS-iphone
For iPhone (iOS) users, that use their phones for study and practice computing 

If you dont want to type clang syntax command directly on your terminal, if you are familiar with make in linux,
so you can use this tool for compiling your C language source codes

in the tool current folder
usage:

python3 make.py file

if is the tool in bin directory
usage:

make file

This tool works for others operating systems but i'm creating for ios / iphone users on LibTerm app 
(for coding)

If you want to move the program to bin directory execute this command:
mv make.py /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/1DAE09F2-6240-4B36-8B6D-E3890D78B3E1/Documents

amd then try run: make
